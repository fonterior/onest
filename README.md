Onest is designed as a hybrid of geometric and humanistic grotesque. The font combines capaciousness and legibility, so it saves space without losing readability.This is the first Moldovan made typeface created with a mere goal â€” to make communication between the state and the citizen honest and understandable. Also, to bring Moldova's image closer to that of a modern, open country. Onest is suitable for reading long texts from the screens of any device and is recommended for government and social service sites.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://simpals.github.io/onest.
